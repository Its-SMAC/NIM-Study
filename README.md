# NIM Study
My work with NIM to improve my skills and understand the language

This repository contains my study of the NIM language, from basic syntax to advanced features, with the goal of better understanding the language.

I hope that, in the end, this repository will be useful for newer NIM programmers.

I welcome tips and advice to improve my skills and turn this “manual” into a good and comprehensive guide for NIM programmers.
